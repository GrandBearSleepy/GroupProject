# Public Holiday Checker

As a busy professional who works across multiple regions, 
I need to see at a glance when holidays are being observed 
so I can schedule events and activities that won't conflict.

As a traveller, 
I want to know my destination country's coming holidays or events and weather, 
so I can plan my  journey.

As a traveller 
I want to know the upcoming events and holidays in the countries I plan to visit as well as context behind them 
so I am culturally informed.

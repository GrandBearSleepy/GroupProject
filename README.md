## Technologies Used
This was an interesting project to execute as it required the merging of multiple 
concepts that we've learned to date.  We had to use client-side storage to persist
data, the UI had to be polished & mobile responsive and we could not use alerts,
confirms or prompts, instead we used modal.

The 2 API's we used were:
 * https://calendarific.com/
 * https://openweathermap.org/
 
The CSS framework we used was:
 * https://materializecss.com/
